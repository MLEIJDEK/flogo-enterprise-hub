# 🧠 TIBCO Flogo® MCP Customer 360 Sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to use **TIBCO Flogo®** to expose **Customer 360 data** — including **customers**, **products**, and **sales** — using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Once deployed, the Flogo MCP Server acts as an intelligent data orchestrator, enabling **AI agents** to query the data using **natural language (NLP)** without requiring any manual orchestration logic from the user.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧩 **Expose business data as MCP-compliant service**  
  Provides access to customer, product, and sales datasets

- 🤖 **NLP-ready interface for AI agents**  
  Seamless integration with AI copilots or assistants to issue natural language queries

- 🔁 **Automatic orchestration**  
  No need to write or manage orchestration logic — **Flogo MCP Server** handles it for you

- 🗃️ **Prebuilt sample datasets**  
  Includes mock data for sales, customer profiles, and product purchases

- 📊 **Supports business-centric queries**, like:
  - _"Show me sales for Q1 2025"_
  - _"List customer names who have purchased more than 2 products and their details"_

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
